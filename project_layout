src/Database/ExampleDBMS/

contains the library code: this is for the server as well as the
client since you can't have two libraries in one cabal. This can be
fixed later by creating multiple cabal projects

src/Database/ExampleDBMS/

src/Database/ExampleDBMS/Network/

contains the network utility code, the client api, the network
protocol and the network server code

src/Database/ExampleDBMS/Server/

contains the server itself which is independent of the network code
wrapper. This deals with managing connections/sessions and tracking
active statements. The api for this server, the network protocol, and
the client lib closely track each other.

src/Database/ExampleDBMS/Values

contains the code for dealing with values, including the type
definitions

src/Database/ExampleDBMS/PhysOpSyntax

This contains the abstract syntax for the physical operators, a
parser, a pretty printer, typechecker and rewrites (desugar, optimise)
for physical operator trees

src/Database/ExampleDBMS/PhysOpImpl

This contains the evaluator for the physical operators and the
functions which implement the physical operators on top of the values.

src/Database/ExampleDBMS/PhysOpImpl/Csv

This contains utils for convering between csv concrete syntax and
values.

src/Database/ExampleDBMS/Storage

This contains the code which implements the storage engine, which also
implements a large part of the transaction management.

src/Database/ExampleDBMS/DataGen

This contains code to help generating data. One of the uses for this
is for implementing tests.


src/Database/ExampleDBMS/Utils

This contains various utils including the pretty printer which
converts values into ascii tables.

src/Database/ExampleDBMS/SQL

This contains the abstract syntax, pretty printer, parser,
typechecker, and tree transforms for the SQL

src/Database/ExampleDBMS/SQLToPhyOps

Contains the conversion between SQL and physical operators.

client/

contains the code for the command line client executable

tests/

contains the code for the tests plus the test runner executable

tests/Database/ExampleDBMS/Tests/TestTypes.lhs

contains the declarative types for describing the tests

tests/Database/ExampleDBMS/Tests/TestEval.lhs

contains the code which converts TestType values into test cases,
currently using test-framework-hunit.

server/

contains the thin wrapper code to run the network server as an
executable
