Simple implementation of an SQL DBMS in Haskell.

Status: barely started.

Goals:

Demonstrate the basics of an SQL DBMS, including:

* implementation of a wide range of queries
* network server
* statement compiler
* statement runtime
* a basic architecture for a DBMS
* command line client
* simple implementation of 'ACID'
* features of a DBMS

The major focus will be on understanding SQL queries in depth.
