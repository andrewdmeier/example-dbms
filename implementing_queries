start of list of comprehensive sql 2011 + dialects for sql queries

= value exprs

== function app

== case
== cast
== greatest, least

== in list

== quoted names

== dates, intervals

== lots more operators
cover all of sql 2011 for prefix, postfix, bin ops

== lots more functions
cover all of sql 2011 for functions

== weird syntax operators
between
extract
etc.

== aggregates
array_agg, string concat agg
sql 2011 agg functions
distinct
order by
filter
within group

== windows
several stages:
very simple: aggs + partitions
+ non agg window functions
+ order by
+ implicit order by frame
+ simple explicit frames
+ non inline frames
+ all the rest

== parameterized
== strings
escape
collate

== arrays
== multisets
== next value for

== more complex typenames

== todo: non scalar expressions

list all the scalar expression syntax which isn't scalar expressions, e.g.:
aggregates
unnest
windows
non scalar subqueries
multiset stuff? array stuff?

= basic aggregates
count, max, min, sum, avg
add group by with columns only
add having

complex expressions in group by, mixing transform and aggregates



= set quantifier in select

= offset and fetch first



= order by
desc
nulls first/last
indexed columns
complex expressions

= schemas
= views

= non natural inner join

= other tref stuff
implicit join
cross join
aliases
parens
subquery
function
multiple joins and associativity

= outer join


= correlation names

= grouping sets

= set ops
basic union, intersect, except
add corresponding
parsing order by
associativity

= non recursive cte
= recursive cte

= values, table

= subqueries

= correlated subqueries

= lateral


= combining scalar context syntax
normal map functions
unnest
aggregates
windows
correlated subquery references (what are these called?)
other subqueries
